NB TYPESCRIPT COMPILES TO JAVASCRIPT FILES

To install Typescript:

    npm install -g typescript
    tsc --help

If you are using NPM you normally fix the version of Typescript to be used like so:

    npm install typescript@'>==4.2.3 <4.3.0

To initialise a new tsconfig.json file

    tsc --init

To compile and run a single Typescript file in this project:

    tsc my_file.js
    node my_file.js

To compile all source files targeted by tsconfig.json, just do:

    tsc

Typically it is quite useful to run a compile `watch` which will auto recompile on file changes

    tsc --watch

If a library does not have type definitions bundled with it, you can install them manually if they are available at definitely typed:

    npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
