Type Definition Files
============================================================================================

> What are type definition files

    - type definition files are shipped with external libraries and contain types and interfaces
    - they have the extension .d.ts
    - if you double click on an exported method you can normally see its definition in a .d.ts file


> What if a library does not contain a .d.ts file


    - most popular libraries have a separate type definition file defined in the repo:  https://github.com/definitelytyped/definitelytyped/#definitelytyped
    - if you go to the Typescript website you can normally find instructions to install the additional types: https://www.typescriptlang.org/dt/search
    - lets say we wanted the lodash library we could simply use the following

        npm install lodash
        npm install --save-dev @types/lodash      // types will not be needed in production code since we compile to JS
